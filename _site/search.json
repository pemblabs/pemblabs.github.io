A delivery mechanism that is very much known in the community.Upon analyzing the file first thing you see is that it‚Äôs ASCII encoded in order to obfuscate its purpose.ASCII encoded PSSo continuing with static analysis of the file I decided to write two simple Python scripts that should do the job to deobfuscate this file. First I copied the obfuscated strings into a file and then create a simple carver to get rid of the unnecessary strings.with open('psscript.txt','r') as f:        ara = f.read().replace("[char]", "")        print(ara)        ara_ara = ara.replace("+", ",")        print(ara_ara)After that, all that was left now is to decode the ASCII strings. For that Python has a built function to make the job easier. I first put each individual carved string into 4 different variables and loop through and joined them to get the intended result.decoded = ''.join(chr(i) for i in snip1)print(decoded)decoded = ''.join(chr(i) for i in snip2)print(decoded)decoded = ''.join(chr(i) for i in snip3)print(decoded)decoded = ''.join(chr(i) for i in snip4)print(decoded)And this is the result of the deobfuscated strings ( don‚Äôt mind the printed statements it‚Äôs good to know how the code is doing üòÅ). So you can see where this is going.Decoded PS scriptSo now let‚Äôs put our decoded strings into their respective place and take a bird‚Äôs eye view to see how the script actually is and go over what it does.Encoded and Decoded scriptNow that we have the beautiful thing here, what is it actually doing?First, it creates an alias called ‚Äúrzs‚Äù which is used to execute a series of commands using the ‚Äúinvoke-expression‚Äù. It assigns a value to the ‚Äúglobal:block‚Äù variable to create a new instance of ‚ÄúSystem.Net.WebClient‚Äù class and then invokes the method ‚ÄúDownlaodString‚Äù of the ‚ÄúWebClient‚Äù instance with our precious URL ‚Äúhxxp://dz7eg[.]top/515/sdfzw.php?i=‚Äù.One interesting is that it concatenates the hostname of the machine to the URL as a parameter perhaps to keep track of the infected devices.If it survives the week perhaps I will see if we can get that 2nd stage payload.Hope you enjoyed it üôÇ God bless you!IOC  SHA256 hash: 9d1582c69b56d7279f4962a9648524d9c57613b8fc2f7ad74fc2fd55f748e200  SHA1 hash: c0b8449c705d2603a419f210ad3c7a2f98941b9b  MD5 hash: c027bbcb1ccdc36e4b742b8d445b73fa  URL: hxxp://dz7eg[.]top/515/sdfzw.php?i=",

Howdy, the name is PEMB and I currently work as a Security Analyst for an oil and gas company here in HTX (aka best city, aka best state).
I started my journey in tech as a Desktop Support for a big Hospital System here in Texas, everything is big here, and then became a full-time student again and graduated from UHCL with a Bachelor of Information Technology  and a minor in...(you guessed it) cybersecurity. I broke into cyber just before my last semester working as Jr. Cybersecurity Analyst for a utility company where I worked for about a year and a half.

There is so much I love about cybersecurity but my favorite bytes would be detection engineering, malware anlysis, sec ops and cyber threat intelligence. A favorite part of my work day involves listening to podcasts on my way to work with SANS ISC StormCast being my bread and butter (can't believe I haven't met Dr. Johannes ðŸ˜­) and my new favorite addition being the Hacker Valley Media.

I love going to conferences specially local ones and hope to someday be a speaker for conferences as I learn and have more things to share. Well this guy also loves playing soccer, guitar and spending time with his friends during free time (He plays Apex). Back to first person, I hope you enjoy the contents shared here and errwhere on my socials.

Expect malware analysis and hunting down malicious infrastructures to all things cyber. Opinions shared here are definetely my own (judge me).

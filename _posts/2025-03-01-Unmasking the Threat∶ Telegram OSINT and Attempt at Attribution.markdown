# Part 2 - The Telegram OSINT
Last time on part 1 we made a deep dive into the overal campaign infrastructure operation revealing multiple indicators and targeted groups. This time Ia am going to focus on the findings related to the odd one, referering to the unique phishing page, I uncovered during the investigation.

*Credential Theft Pipeline*
Among all the repositories whith the same phishing kit deployment, the repo "servdatapage" had a different phishing kit which did not employ the "VIP Email Only" technique. The kit which seems to have been created by another threat actor by the name of "Abilitytiger" had a simple look mimicking a webmail. The webpage included an event listener function for the submit button that captures the email and password, and sends data via AJAX POST request to the "get1.php" file. The "get1.php" is responsible for collecting additonal host information, construct the message body with the collected host data before sending it to an email, telegram channel, and save it locally.

*Message Construct*
The credential is distributed in a way that would provide redundancy and resiliency by saving it in 3 completely different ways.
First, it sent to the "norereply@noway.com" email. A quick osint at the domain, reveals other emails under "noway.com" domain such as "fake@noway.com", "nevermind@noway.com" and similar more.

*Send-to email*
Second, we see the file "log1ns.txt" being opened to append the harvested credentials and host data locally. This file is the same which was most likely commited to github by mistake and revealed potentially the location of our threat actor.

*Credentials Saved Locally*
Lastly, the same message constructed with the harvested credentials and host data is sent to a telegram bot chatid. Having the chatID and token available made it possible to do telegram osint and find additonal information on our threat actor and its extended infrastructure.

### Telegram OSINT 101
In order to safely do osint and gather additional infortmations, I decided to use Tor browser to interact with the Telagram's API through GET requests and commands. I initially constructed the request with the "getUpdate" command but we got an error as a response, so I used the "getMe" gave the formatted response below.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": {
    "id": 7192456887,
    "is_bot": true,
    "first_name": "PrettyDay2024",
    "username": "RageDaybot",
    "can_join_groups": true,
    "can_read_all_group_messages": false,
    "supports_inline_queries": false,
    "can_connect_to_business": false,
    "has_main_web_app": false
  }
}
```
The construct is as simple as sending a Get request to "hxxps://api[.]telegram.org/bot<YourBotToken>/<command>". This request request revealed the firstname under the account but most importantly that it indeed a bot as we see the value "is_bot" returned "true" and the name of the bot.

*Telagram API Response*

Navigating to the profile page on the Telegram app didn't reveal any new information.

*Telagram bot RageDaybot aka PrettyDay2024*

With not having much to go about from there all that was left was our chatid. Having ran multiple commands, the most useful was the "getChat" which provided us new findings. 

The chatid does not belong to a group or channel since it was a positive number instead of a negative number. You might think this colds be infered from the chatis which I already had, but it is not so since the API query would have not contained a hyphen. The response also revealed an interesting names for the account as shown below.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": {
    "id": 1713866119,
    "first_name": "Local",
    "last_name": "PD",
    "username": "DogeatDogWorldx1",
    "type": "private",
    "can_send_gift": true,
    "active_usernames": [
      "DogeatDogWorldx1"
    ],
    "photo": {
      "small_file_id": "AQADAQADdrExG5aYSUUACAIAA4eFJ2YABES8BJOCNwVJNgQ",
      "small_file_unique_id": "AQADdrExG5aYSUUAAQ",
      "big_file_id": "AQADAQADdrExG5aYSUUACAMAA4eFJ2YABES8BJOCNwVJNgQ",
      "big_file_unique_id": "AQADdrExG5aYSUUB"
    },
    "max_reaction_count": 11,
    "accent_color_id": 0
  }
}
```
### Put a Tin Foil Hat On

If you are following the follow the story you would remember that on Part 1 I revealed that the most targeted organization after aggreagating all the emails I found on the threat actor's github repositories, was the "pcsonet.com" with exactly 1,500 emails targeted. Well if you go to "pcsonet.com" you will be redirected to the "pinellassheriff.gov" which is the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. You might also wonder whether this an insider threat issue, or a disgranted cop. Who knows?

As you can see the API response reveals the first_name to be "Local" and the last_name "PD". Whether this is a coincidence I will leave that up to you, but let's follow the trail and see where I ended. In addition to that we see an interesting username "DogeatDogWorldx1" and we see a profile photo on the account.

![dogeatdog]({{site.baseurl}}/images/dogeatdog.png)
*Local PD aka DogeatDogWorldx1*

Still with the tin foil hat, I found that "DogeatDogWorld" seems to be a thing or perhaps it's unique trait of our threat actor. Multiple accounts with similar username were recently active with other being inactive for a while. The Local PD was the most recently active and I witnessed as well showing "active 5 minutes ago".

### Attribution - The A Word

Before I go on to present additional findings and even poiting similarities to other independent accounts or users, I must state that this by no means should be used to derive a conclusion on any participation or authorship in this activity by the said accounts. Having thought much about as well, I deemed only fair to present all findings and the connections made from all the dots.

### Who Are They?

So I continued gathering open source intelligence on our Local PD in the same manner I was conducting. I retrieved all the forms of profile photos which basically only difference in size most likelly for different devices. My attempt was to see if there are any other past profile photos.

![pd photos]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pdphotos.png)
*GetUserprofilePhotos Response*

Unsing the image I was able to retrieve, I performed a reverse image lookup which took me to a "fandom.com" of VRChat Legends displaying similar and the exact same banner found in the telegram profile photo.

![fandom]({{site.baseurl}}/images/fandom.png)
*VRChat Legends Wiki*

Having navigated around, I found that the page is actively maintained over the years amd that the purpose of the community is to join a Virtual Reality chat world. Their characters mostly resemble a cat which makes sense because one of the banners says "Neko Police", neko being the japanese work for "cat". All of this information about the nature of the fandom community I found from videos and images they post on their discord server. The discord server has alot of members and many of them are very active with about 6k+ online at once.

### Additional Cross Reference and Conclusion

Well as I feared, the article has become too long for my liking so here is some additional findings and coclusion for this.

I did cross reference of the usernames I found so far to see any commonality and this was true for "Abilitytiger", the phish kit maker, and "RageDaybot".

*Abilitytiger username Refences*

![ragedaybot reference]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pronounybot.png)
*Ragedaybot username Refences*

Although many of the references were inactive, both usernames where found to have reference to a site called "Pronouny" which I foud its repo on github. The repo is maitained mainly by two user who appear to be seasonal developers.

In short, I can finally confirm that the threat actor armandabors' github account has been disabled and hopefully disrupting the operations. 

Happy Hunting!
